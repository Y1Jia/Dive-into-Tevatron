# README

"Dive-into-Tevatron" includes my learning notes on using Tevatron to reproduce a dense retrieval model, specifically the bi-encoder model on the MS-MARCO passage ranking dataset.

> Tevatron is a simple and efficient toolkit for training and running dense retrievers with deep language models. The toolkit has a modularized design for easy research; a set of command line tools are also provided for fast development and testing. A set of easy-to-use interfaces to Huggingface's state-of-the-art pre-trained transformers ensures Tevatron's superior performance.
